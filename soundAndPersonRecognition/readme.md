# ðŸŽ¤ Sound & Person Recognition

A collection of scripts for detecting sound levels, recognizing persons with a lightweight model, and performing real-time speech recognition using a fork of Whisper.

## âœ¨ Features

-   **Noise Level Detection**: Monitors microphone input to detect ambient noise levels, which can be used as a trigger in an event-driven system.
-   **Person Recognition**: Employs a lightweight, low-quality model for quick and efficient person detection, suitable for embedded systems.
-   **Real-time Speech Recognition**: Contains a forked and potentially modified version of Whisper for real-time speech-to-text processing.

## ðŸ“‚ Scripts & Purpose

This directory contains several scripts focused on environmental perception:

-   A script to **recognize noise levels**.
-   A script for **person detection** using a simple model.
-   A **fork of Whisper** for real-time speech recognition experiments.

*Note: This component is a collection of individual scripts rather than a single runnable project. Each script serves a specific purpose within the larger event-driven architecture.*
