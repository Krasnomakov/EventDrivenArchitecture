# ðŸš€ Ellie Connected v2: Advanced Interaction

This folder contains a more advanced and robust implementation of the event-driven architecture, featuring multiple interaction modes, enhanced gesture control, and a more modular structure.

## âœ¨ Key Features

- **Multi-Mode System**: Seamlessly switch between different modes:
  - **Resting Animation**: An idle-state animation.
  - **Mode Selection**: Use hand gestures (number of fingers) to select the active mode.
  - **Brick Pong**: A fully playable game with a MediaPipe hand controller.
- **Movement Detection**: Uses OpenCV to detect movement and can relaunch the system if no activity is detected.
- **LLM Integration**: Includes a prototype (`ollamaToPixelatedLetters`) for interacting with a small language model using a hand controller.
- **Drawing Mode**: Allows users to draw on a simulated pixel LED wall.

## ðŸ“‚ Core Components

-   `modeSelection/`: The main, event-driven master script that orchestrates the different modes. It handles the animation, mode selection via finger counting, and the Brick Pong game.

## ðŸ§ª Experimental & Partial Implementations

This directory also contains various prototypes and components that explore different aspects of the architecture:

-   `brickPongVersions/`: Contains various attempts to optimize Python code with CuPy, Numba, and other methods to improve performance on the Jetson Nano.
-   `versions/`: Partial implementations of the event-driven architecture, including individual components like counters, detectors, and controllers.
-   `Flask server to handle events/`: A simple Flask server implementation designed to receive requests and trigger events in the system.
-   `ollamaToPixelatedLetters/`: A prototype that runs a small LLM (Ollama) with an AI hand controller and pixelated text output.
-   `drawing mode/`: Different animation and video projection experiments for drawing on the simulated LED wall.
