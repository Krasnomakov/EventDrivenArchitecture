# ü§ñ AI Event-Driven 8-bit LED Screen

An interactive art & gaming project using event-driven architecture to control an 8-bit LED screen simulation.

## üöÄ Overview

This repository contains prototypes and components of an AI event-driven architecture for controlling an 8-bit LED screen simulation. The project includes several modes such as animations, drawing, games, and interaction with large language models (LLM).

## ‚ú® Features

- **Real-time Animations**: Dynamic animations on an 8-bit LED screen.
- **Gesture Control**: Hand and pose recognition for interactive experiences.
- **Game Integrations**: Classic games like Snake and Brick Pong controlled by gestures.
- **User Recognition**: Detects and recognizes users to personalize experiences.
- **Object Detection**: Uses YOLOv9 for video effects based on detected objects.
- **Sound Detection**: Reacts to sound levels in the environment.

## üì¶ Components & Demos

Here's a breakdown of the different components in this repository and links to their demos.

| Component | Description | Demo |
|---|---|---|
| `C/` | Various animations, movement detection, and pose/hand recognition on Jetson Nano. Includes snake and brick pong games implemented in C/C++. | <ul><li>[üé¨ Event-Driven Architecture](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IVOBHTk2JU5LjdZWM55VMYE9VPgmm1oh/view?usp=sharing)</li><li>[üß± Brick Pong](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15immDvVE9rzHjOSAga4jwyM3pBoCWAVq/view?usp=sharing)</li><li>[üêç Snake](https://drive.google.com/file/d/13E9lRFCfXW6GLsjpQeqEjfcrZtrPX8RK/view?usp=sharing)</li></ul> |
| `Ellie_connected/` | MobileNet for user recognition, Mediapipe for BrickPong hand controller, autolaunch when user is detected. | [‚ñ∂Ô∏è Watch Demo](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wkesS2F_0U0m1K3RxaZood4mVLbymh6d/view?usp=sharing) |
| `Ellie_connected_v2/` | A more robust version with resting animation, OpenCV movement detection, hand gesture mode selection, and a hand-controlled Brick Pong. It relaunches when no movement is detected. | [‚ñ∂Ô∏è Watch Demo](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14VgP01R4UeSrjxccz6_b1pInGMkk3tBn/view?usp=sharing) |
| `flaskServerWith3DEffects/` | YOLOv9 object detection integrated to create video effects and animations. | [‚ñ∂Ô∏è Watch Demo](https://vimeo.com/929837304/6112b0460f?share=copy) |
| `soundAndPersonRecognition/` | Scripts for detecting sound levels and recognizing persons using a simple OpenCV model. | *No demo available* |
